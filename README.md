# SlimBoot

This repository contains a skeleton for quick bootstrapping of your project.

## What's included?
* [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/)
* [RedBean](http://redbeanphp.com/)
* [Twig template engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

Plus a sassy gulp setup

## Requirements
* [PHP 5.4+](http://php.net/)

#### For buildning with gulp you need
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) - which in turn requires ruby and rubygems

## Installation
Clone or download the repo and run these commands in your project root:
```
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
$ npm install
```
You then build the project with ```$ gulp```

## Coding convention
SlimBoot expects your controller files to be named ```MyController.php``` and class name should be ```MyController```. When called from the router the argument should be lowercase and without the 'Controller' suffix. Like this: ```$app->controller('my');```

Please note that you should never have to edit source files in the `/public/` folder. Those files are generated by `$ gulp`

## Credits
Some ideas and code borrowed from [slim-app-template](https://github.com/magnus-eriksson/slim-app-template) by my good friend Magnus Eriksson.
